This is the final step of my Racket DSL implementation roadmap.
It consists in promoting Tiny-HDL as a standalone language with two flavors:
a Lisp-like syntax and a custom syntax.

<!-- more -->

Tiny-HDL Language flavors
=========================

Since the beginning of this series, we have considered that the syntax
of Tiny-HDL was based on S-expressions.
This was natural and necessary because Tiny-HDL was only available as a Racket
library.
In step 6, we want to make Tiny-HDL a standalone language with two syntax
variants:

* *Vanilla*, for parentheses lovers, will keep the S-expression-based
  syntax that you already know,
* *Spicy* will have a custom syntax loosely inspired by VHDL and Verilog.

The *vanilla* description of the half adder will look like this:

```racket
#lang tiny-hdl/vanilla

(entity half-adder ([input a] [input b] [output s] [output co]))

(architecture half-adder-arch half-adder
  (assign s  (xor a b))
  (assign co (and a b)))
```

Compared to the same example in step 5, the noticeable changes are:

* The `#lang racket` directive has beed replaced by `#lang tiny-hdl/vanilla`.
* The `(require tiny-hdl)` form has been removed.
* The Tiny-HDL code is no longer wrapped in a `(begin-tiny-hdl ...)` form.

And here is the *spicy* version of the same half-adder:

```
#lang tiny-hdl/spicy

entity half-adder
    input a
    input b
    output s
    output co
end

architecture half-adder-arch of half-adder
  s  <= a xor b
  co <= a and b
end
```

In both cases, the `#lang` directive will have the following effect:

1. Racket will look up, and run, a *reader* for the chosen language flavor.
   A reader is basically a *parser* that converts a source file into a
   syntax object.
2. The syntax object will come wrapped in a `#%module-begin` form that serves
   as a hook for macro expansion.
   Racket provides a default implementation of the `#%module-begin` macro, but
   we can provide our own to customize the expansion.

Implementing the *vanilla* flavor
=================================

Since Racket comes with a built-in S-expression parser, there is very little
work to do.
First, we create a module `vanilla/lang/reader.rkt` with the following content.

```racket
#lang s-exp syntax/module-reader
tiny-hdl/vanilla/lang/expander
```

This file specifies that Tiny-HDL will use the default Racket *reader*, and the
language implementation will be provided by the module `tiny-hdl/vanilla/lang/expander`.
You can read more about the [syntax/module-reader](https://docs.racket-lang.org/guide/syntax_module-reader.html)
language in the Racket guide.

In the module `vanilla/lang/expander.rkt`, we implement a custom `#%module-begin`
macro that wraps its body in a `begin-tiny-hdl` form.
This macro has been named `tiny-hdl-module-begin` internally because we need to
keep a reference to the original `#%module-begin` from Racket:

```racket
#lang racket

(require tiny-hdl)

(provide
  (all-from-out tiny-hdl)
  (rename-out [tiny-hdl-module-begin #%module-begin])
  xor and or not)

(define-syntax-rule (tiny-hdl-module-begin body ...)
  (#%module-begin
    (begin-tiny-hdl body ...)))
```

This module also provides the boolean operators from Racket as part of Tiny-HDL.

And that's it!
The *vanilla* flavor of Tiny-HDL is complete.

Implementing the *spicy* flavor
===============================

There are several techniques to write a custom *reader* with Racket.
You can either write a parser by hand, use one of the available
parsing libraries like [Megaparsack](https://docs.racket-lang.org/megaparsack/index.html?q=megaparsack),
or use a parser generator like [Brag](https://docs.racket-lang.org/brag/index.html?q=brag).

To implement the *spicy* flavor of Tiny-HDL, I have chosen to use Brag.

The reader module
-----------------

This time, the `spicy/lang/reader.rkt` module defines custom versions of
the [`read` and `read-syntax`](https://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/Reading.html#%28def._%28%28quote._~23~25kernel%29._read%29%29)
functions.

```racket
#lang s-exp syntax/module-reader
tiny-hdl/spicy/lang/expander
#:read                tiny-hdl-read
#:read-syntax         tiny-hdl-read-syntax
#:whole-body-readers? #t

(require "lexer.rkt" "grammar.rkt")

(define (tiny-hdl-read in)
  (syntax->datum (tiny-hdl-read-syntax #f in)))

(define (tiny-hdl-read-syntax src ip)
  (list (parse src (tokenize ip))))
```

As you can see, `tiny-hdl-read-syntax` uses two functions:

* `tokenize`, imported from `lexer.rkt`, converts a Tiny-HDL source file into a token stream.
* `parse`, imported from `grammar.rkt`, converts a token stream into a syntax object.

`tiny-hdl-read` is an alternate reader that returns a datum.

The lexical analyser
--------------------

The lexical analyzer (*lexer*, or *tokenizer*) is implemented in
`spicy/lang/lexer.rkt`.
It uses the [brag/support](https://docs.racket-lang.org/brag/index.html?q=brag%2Fsupport#%28mod-path._brag%2Fsupport%29)
module that provides facilities for creating lexers:

```racket
#lang racket

(require brag/support)

(provide tokenize)

(define (tokenize ip)
  (port-count-lines! ip)
  (define tiny-hdl-lexer
    (lexer-src-pos
      [(:or "use" "entity" "input" "output"
            "architecture" "of" "end"
            "and" "or" "not" "xor"
            "<=" ":" "." "(" ")")
       (token lexeme (string->symbol lexeme))]
      [(:or "false" "true")
       (token 'BOOLEAN (eq? lexeme "true"))]
      [(:seq alphabetic (:* (:or alphabetic numeric "_" "-")))
       (token 'ID (string->symbol lexeme))]
      [(from/to "\"" "\"")
       (token 'STRING (trim-ends "\"" lexeme "\""))]
      [whitespace
       (token 'WHITESPACE lexeme #:skip? #t)]
      [(eof)
       (void)]))
  (Î» () (tiny-hdl-lexer ip)))
```

`tokenize` returns a function that reads an input port `ip` and returns
a new token each time it is called.
Tokens are generated by matching the character sequence from the input port
against regular expression patterns:

* A keyword, operator or punctuation mark (`use`, `entity`, ...) is converted into a symbol token.
* A boolean literal (`false`, `true`) is converted into a `BOOLEAN` token with a Racket boolean value (`#f`, `#t`).
* An identifier is converted into an `ID` token with a symbol value.
* A string literal is converted into a `STRING` token whose value is the string content.
* Whitespace is matched against a built-in `whitespace` rule and converted into
  a `WHITESPACE` token that will be ignored.
* The *end-of-file* condition returns `(void)` as a termination indicator for the parser.

The parser
----------

The parser is specified as a grammar in `spicy/lang/grammar.rkt`
using the Brag language.
The beauty of it is that Brag itself is implemented as a Racket DSL with
a custom syntax.

The starting rule of the grammar is `begin-tiny-hdl`.
It defines a Tiny-HDL module as a sequence of *use* clauses, entities
and architectures:

```
#lang brag

begin-tiny-hdl: (use | entity | architecture)*
```

When this rule matches, the parser generates a syntax object with a root
form `begin-tiny-hdl` whose body is a sequence of syntax objects for `use`,
`entity`, and `architecture` forms.

A *use* clause is composed of the keyword `use` followed by a string literal.
The `/` character below means that the keyword `use` will be discarded from
the output to prevent a double `use` symbol in the result:

```
use: /"use" STRING
```

Similarly, we define the `entity` rule that generates an `entity` form.
All keywords are discarded from the result.
We define a separate rule `port-list` to force the port declarations
to be kept in a list inside the `entity` form.
However, we don't want the names `port-list` and `port` to be part of the result:

```
entity: /"entity" ID port-list /"end"

/port-list: port*

/port: ("input" | "output") ID
```

The `architecture` rule behaves a little differently.
In this case, we want the `instance` and `assign` forms to be direct children
of the `architecture` form.
For this reason, we do not define a separate `statement-list` rule,
and the `statement` rule is marked as *spliced* using the `@` indicator:

```
architecture: /"architecture" ID /"of" ID statement* /"end"

@statement: instance | assign

instance: ID /":" ID

assign: port-ref /"<=" expression
```

The following rules define the syntax of boolean expressions
and the operator precedence:

```
@expression: or | or-term

or:       (or-term /"or")+ or-term
@or-term: xor | xor-term

xor:       xor-term /"xor" xor-term
@xor-term: and | and-term

and:       (and-term /"and")+ and-term
@and-term: not | not-term

not: "not" not-term
@not-term: BOOLEAN
         | port-ref
         | /"(" expression /")"

@port-ref: ID | instance-port-ref

/instance-port-ref: ID /"." ID
```

Language module
---------------

Finally, the `spicy/lang/expander.rkt` module exports the definitions
needed to expand Tiny-HDL code.
In this case, since the `begin-tiny-hdl` form is already part of the generated
syntax object, we do not redefine the `#%module-begin` macro:

```racket
#lang racket

(require tiny-hdl)

(provide
  (all-from-out tiny-hdl)
  xor and or not
  #%module-begin)
```
